# 1. Word Embeddings
- Word2Vec model requires some text corpora for training.
- How to train a Word2Vec model
  - By learning to predict context (neighboring words) given one word.
  - By learning to predict omitted word by it's context.
  - By applying stochastic gradient descent.
  - By minimizing crossentropy (aka maximizing likelihood).
