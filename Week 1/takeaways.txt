1. GD vs. Analytical Solution
- GD doesn't require to invert a matrix
- GD is more scalable and can be applied for problems with high number of features

2. Large model weights can indicate that model is overfitted.
- Because it is a sign of an unstable network where small changes in the input can lead to large changes in the output.

3. Disadvantages of model validation on holdout sample
- It can give biased quality esitimates for small samples
- It is sensitive to the the particular split of the sample into training and test parts.
